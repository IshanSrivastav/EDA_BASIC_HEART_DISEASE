# Heart Disease EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)

This project performs an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a heart disease dataset using data visualization techniques. The goal is to gain insights and understand the relationships between different features that might help in predicting heart disease.

## Prerequisites

Before running this project, you need to have the following Python libraries installed:
